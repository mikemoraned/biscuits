# Spike: Contour Following

- [x] canvas setup which shows random overlapping circles in black on white
- [ ] experimental implementation of ["square tracing algorithm"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_tracing):
  - [x] add rust interface which takes black and white image and returns a list of turtle pos (can just be random for now)
  - [ ] trace turtle positions on screen
  - [ ] add sliding bar which allows them to be traced and untraced
  - [ ] implement simple square tracing algorithm
  - [ ] implement ["Jacob's stopping criterion."](http://www.imageprocessingplace.com/downloads_V3/root_downloads/tutorials/contour_tracing_Abeer_George_Ghuneim/square.html)
