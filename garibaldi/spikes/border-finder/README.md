# Spike: Contour Following

- [x] canvas setup which shows random overlapping circles in black on white
- [x] experimental implementation of ["square tracing algorithm"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_tracing):
  - [x] add rust interface which takes black and white image and returns a list of points in the contour
  - [x] trace contour on screen
  - [x] find first foreground pixel
  - [x] implement simple square tracing algorithm
  - [x] implement ["Jacob's stopping criterion."](http://www.imageprocessingplace.com/downloads_V3/root_downloads/tutorials/contour_tracing_Abeer_George_Ghuneim/square.html)
