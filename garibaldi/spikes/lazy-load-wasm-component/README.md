# Spike: Lazy Loading Wasm Component

- [x] Use React Suspense / Lazy to lazy-load a vanilla component
- [x] Wrap in loader function and add artificial delay
- [x] return a dynamic definition of a module, which binds to local values
- [x] Convert vanilla component to instead lazy load biscuiting lib
- [x] Convert the thing which needs wasm library into a callback function
- [x] Add args that are passed to the dynamically constructed component
